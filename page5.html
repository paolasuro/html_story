<p>It's vivid blue color left you hypnotized. You felt as if your body wasn't
  your own as you slowly lift your hand to grab the blueberries. You gather a
  hand full of them and look at them as they sit in your hand, the sun shining
  on them as if it was a spotlight. Your stomach grawls again as you look at
  your hands.</p>
