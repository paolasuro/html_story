You quickly lift your hand and throw the blueberries in your mouth. They're
sweet and refreshing and your hungry stomach thanks you for the food. You go to
grab some more but your head starts to feel dizzy. Thinking maybe you just need
more water because of the heat you grab your water bottle and take a few sips.
However, you're still just as dizzy if not even more. You stumble towards the
chairs and table you saw earlier. You close your eyes and sit down for a few
minutes. You contemplate whether you should call for help on your phone or give
yourself a few more minutes to pull yourself together.</p>
