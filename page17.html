You open the pantry door, you take out your phone to use as a flashlight. You
step inside  and find shelves filled with a bunch of jars containing what is most
likely expired food. You continue to look around and find some boxes on the
floor. You place your phone on one of the shelves above you. You move the boxes
out of the way to see what's inside but when you grab your phone to look at the
boxes you see a small door. After trying to open it you see that it has a key
hole. You get up and start searching throughout the kitchen, checking every
cabinet and drawer for a key but you find nothing.  </p>
