Slowly, you step on the stairs that lead to the front door. Hoping that the old
wood won't give way and break on you. You make it to the front door. You look
behind you once again to make sure if anyone might happen to see you but there's
nothing there. Your hand shakes as it slowly reaches out toward the door handle.
You twist the handle and to your surprise, it opens. The door makes a loud
creaking sound as you open it. You step into the house and quickly shut the door
behind you. You take a second to look around you.</p>
