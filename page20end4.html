You decided to give up and go home. You realize that none of this is worth your
time. Searching around an old house was pointless. It was probably going to be
something lame and just another disappointment so it's not worth it. Plus, it
was getting late anyway, and you shouldn't stay out especially here at night.
You put everything back where it was as if you were never there. As you step
outside you look around one more time to see if anyone was there, there was no
one and you continue your run back home as if nothing ever happened.
