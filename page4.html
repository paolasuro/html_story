<p>With no one to keep the garden at bay, the plants have practically taken
over, creating a blanket of vibrant colors from the fruits and vegetables that
are unlike any other. The bright colors of the fruits and vegetables are a bold
contrast to the greenery surrounding them. The air is filled with a sweet scent
that makes your stomach growl a bit. You're left speechless for a minute but as
you get closer and the more you look at them the more you start to realize some
of these fruits and vegetables aren't like anything you've seen or eaten. In
front of you is what appears to be blueberries. </p>
