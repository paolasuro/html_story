You dust yourself off and start heading over towards the shed, your palms
brushing against each other to get rid of any lingering dirt. As you approach
the door, you struggle to open the door at first as it has rusted over the
years. But after failing a few times you give the door one big tug and you
finally get the door open. You pull out your phone to use as a flashlight and
start searching. You find a few tools but not what you were looking for, in
the back of the shed, leaning up against the wall was a shovel.</p>
