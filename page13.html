You immediately start digging with your hands. Your hands, arms, and legs
quickly get covered in the dirt but you're too eager to know what's inside the
chest to care about how dirty you are. You start to get antsy and tired as your
arms and legs start to hurt from the endless digging. However, you push through
the pain, and you finally get to the chest, you drag it out of the hole with
the leftover strength you have. After taking a second to breath, you step
towards the front of the chest only to see a lock on the chest.  </p>
