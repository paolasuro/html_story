You begin to climb up the stairs being cautious just like before. You jump at
every creaking sound the stairs make, keeping your fingers crossed that none of
the steps break. You make it upstairs and there are only two doors. The one on
your left leads to a bathroom. Instead of a matching pastel pink bathroom like
the kitchen, it was a pastel green. There was no wallpaper but it had tile
covering the walls and floor. You search the bathroom and find nothing. You try
the other door and it leads to a bedroom. The room is small. It has blue and
green floral wallpaper. The bed is up against the corner to the left with a tiny
wooden nightstand next to it and a dresser on the left side of the wall. The
bedding is a faded blue and has holes it in from the moths over the years. You
search through the dresser but come up empty-handed, just old clothes that were
left behind. You don't give up and look through the nightstand. And in the last
drawer there is a faded drawing of what looks like the layout of the house with
an X on some part of the backyard.   </p>
