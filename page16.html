The kitchen is frozen in time, it has pastel pink cabinets but now they are
faded and you can tell time hasn't been kind to them, showing the wear and tear
of neglect they faced. They were white countertops but are now covered in stains
from water dripping down over time. The walls were covered in floral wallpaper
that are already starting to peel. You could see the dust lingering in the air
as the sun poured in from the bay window, shining on the dining table it homed.
There is a door to the left that leads to a pantry.   </p>
