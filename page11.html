You get up and dust yourself off, you quickly make it to the shed since you're
so curious as to what is in the chest. You struggle to open the door as it has
rusted over the years. But with one big tug, you finally get the door open. You
pull out your phone to use as a flashlight and start searching. You find a few
tools but not what you were looking for in the back of the shed, leaning up
against the wall is a shovel. Just what you needed. You quickly grab it and
rush back to the garden. You start digging up the chest and when you finally get
it out you let out a sigh of joy only to then let out a sigh of disappointment
as you realize it has a lock on it. </p>
