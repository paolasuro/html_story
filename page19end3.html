  Quickly but carefully you go back downstairs and go to the pantry, you dig for
  the key you put it in your pocket and see if it's the right key and it works
  the lock clicks and you open the door to find a bag. Opening the bag ever so
  carefully, inside you find a red dress, a long black-haired wig, a red
  lipstick, and more pictures. You look at the picture and see a woman witha red
  lip and long black hair wearing the dress in the bag posing around the house
  you're in right now. But you take a closer look and realize that lady looks
  familiar. You quickly grab the pictures you find in the chest and begin to
  look through them once more. You stop at a picture taken of two men together
  at the beach. You hold the pictures against each other. One of the men had the
  same striking blue eyes as the woman in the red dress. You flip over the
  picture of the woman in the dress and read "The only time I've ever felt like
  myself" A tear rolls down your eye as you place everything back in the bag.
  You close the small door and head back outside to put the journal, old pictures,
  and key back in the chest. You cover up the chest and put everything back like
  it was and walk home as the sunsets.
