Determined to find out what's in the chest you plant your feet and tighten your
grip on the shovel as you close your eyes and slam the shovel down against the
lock. You open your eyes but nothing. The lock is still intact. You once again
plant your feet and tighten your grip on the shovel as you close your eyes and
slam the shovel down against the lock. You open your eyes again and this time
the lock is lying in the dirt broken. Quickly, you drop the shovel and open the
chest. Inside of it is a beaten-up journal, old pictures, and a key. Filled with
pictures of places around the world and pictures of people. People who you
assume are the family that lived in the yellow. You set down the pictures and
begin to look through one of the journals. Some pages there were pressed flowers
scattered throughout the pages and sketches of a woman wearing a red off the
shoulder dress with long black hair and red lipstick, on other pages there is
some writing, probably a diary of some sort. Mentioning of a man they met at a
bar while working in Spain. They spent the summer together, explored the
country, went on hikes in the mountians, went on a day trip to the beach. The
entrees were full of every single detail of this person's days but on the next
page it was short. <p class="red">“He has to leave and I don't know when he's coming back.”</p>
The entrees continued to be short and the dates weren't consist. The last page
it says <p class="red"> “I saw him again. I wanted to go up to him. To tell him I missed him.
Asked him why he didn't come find me. But he was with someone else. A woman.
They were holding hands but not each others. They were holding a child's hand.
They were all smiling. The same smile he would make when he was with me. I could
never be abe to give him what he wants. I ask God every day why he didn't make
me how I know I'm suppose to be. I'm stuck like this. I want to be the real me.”</p>
You take the journal, old pictures, and a key with you and start walking toward
the house.   </p>
