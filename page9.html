You pick one blueberry and pop it into your mouth. They're sweet and refreshing
and your hungry stomach thanks you for the food. You go to grab some more but
your stomach starts to hurt a bit. You look at the blueberries once more, you
decide it's best to not have anymore and you let them fall to the ground. Even
though your stomach still hurts it's nothing you can't push through. Now you're
left with a decision to make. </p>
