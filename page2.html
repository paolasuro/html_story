<p>You slowly approach the yellow house, looking behind you to see if anyone is
  there. The yellow house had a small porch in the front with white railings and
  columns well what use to be white and yellow paint since it's all chipped and
  peeling from the time. It was two stories high and a chimney sticking out of
  the left side of the house. And on the right it had to a large bay window so
  the sun could light up the room. The door was a dark red with a window
  at the top. On the sides of the house there was fence made of bricks and on
  the right was a metal gate that leads towards the backyard.</p>
