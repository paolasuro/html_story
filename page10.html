<p>You start by exploring the left side of the overgrown garden. But you find
nothing of interest. All that’s left is to turn around and explore the right
side of the overgrown garden. When you get there and start looking around your
shoe catches on to something and you trip. You scrape your knee a bit, and a few drops
 of blood slide down your leg, you might get a bruise in a few days but nothing
 you can’t handle. After ensuring your leg is fine you look at what you
 tripped on. It seems to be a piece of wood. You try to grab it but it’s too
 heavy. You move some of the dirt around and realize it’s a chest.  </p>
