You open your eyes still dizzy as you slowly grab your phone out of your pocket.
It's as if you didn't know how to work a phone. Your brain feels like scrambled
eggs but you push through and find the keypad and dial 911. You tell the operator
as much as you can without throwing up or passing out. The ambulance is on its
way but with your head spinning uncontrollably it feels like a lifetime. When
they finally arrive you barely have the strength to scream “I'm here! Help me!”
You hear the sound of footsteps as you lose the strength to keep your eyes
closed.</p>
<p> When you wake up, you're surrounded but the faces of your family and
  friends. They tell you how they got a call from the hospital about you.
  Appearently, the blueberries were not blueberries at all but poisonous berries
  that if you eat too much of could be deadly. But you were lucky they found you
  in time or who knows what could have happened.
