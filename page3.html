<p>You cautiously try to open the rusted gate surrounding the house. The weeds
and vines make it a bit difficult but with a bit of a running start you finally
get the gate open. Having to move some leaves and branches from hitting your
face you make it to the backyard. To your left, a small deck with a table,
chairs and a door that leads back to the house. To your right sits a run down
shed that is up against the brick wall and what you can infer is a overgrown
garden from the wooden rectangles on the floor.</p>
