<p> Maybe deciding to go for a run in a different neighborhood wasn't the best
idea but it's too late to change your mind. You decide to stop under a tree
for a water break. As you close your water bottle you look across the street,
finally being able to take in your surroundings. Seeing one small yellow house.
You take in its beauty and imagine who lived there, what was their life like,
did they have kids, or pets, and why did they leave? You have an internal battle
with yourself if you should get a closer look. But you just couldn't help yourself... </p>
