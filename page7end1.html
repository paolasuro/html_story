As you close your eyes once more, you feel the breeze tickle your skin. Almost
as if someone is softly dragging their fingers across your skin. The sound of
the leaves brushing up one another fills your ears as if someone was right next
to you comforting and telling you to relax and that everything is going to be
alright. When you finally decide to open your eyes again, you're welcomed by the
sky filled with small clouds and a gradient of pink and orange. It seems that
you fell asleep for a while. You take your phone out of your pocket to check the
time, only to be bombarded with calls and messages from family and friends
asking where you are. You think it's strange for them to call and send so many
messages when you've only been gone for a few hours, but you check the date and
realize you've been here for three days. You practically fly out of the chair at
this realization and start running back home.  </p>
